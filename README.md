The Library of Babel in Toki Pona

kama pona! My name is Luke and I made this website to practice my Toki Pona and coding skills.

The Library of Babel is a short story by Jorge Luis Borges, in which every possible combination of the letters of the alphabet exists in a vast library. I wanted to emulate a smaller version of it, but instead of it being filled predominantly with nonsense, I used Toki Pona, the minimalist constructed language created by Sonja Lang, to allow more opportunities to find meaning, though the text is still mostly ungrammatical.

Every permutation of 16 or less Toki Pona words can be found inside this library at several locations. You can search for text or retrieve the page at a given address of 32 hexadecimal characters, allowing for over 1.2 Ã— 10^24 Toki Pona sentences. If you keep the address of the page, you can revisit the exact same page any time.

If you have any suggestions/improvements for the Toki Pona text or anything else here, pls lmk :)
